					The activities of which I was responsible in Terni Digital Week, have been various, even if most was dedicated to the IT aspect. I helped carry and place parts of the material, and was entrusted with the management of the computers.
					<br> I often stayed to help several hours more than those that were written returning even at 8 in the evening, when almost all were already gone. 
					<br> The expected working time was from 8:30 to 13:00 and from 14:00 to 17:30. From Monday to Friday, while Saturday was from 9:30 to 14:00, although I often stopped in the afternoon.

					The activities of which I was responsible in RadioGalileo, initially were simple. Initially I was transcribing content from analog cassette to digital file.
					<br>When I did the task they told me that I seemed enthusiastic about helping. So, as a result of testing my skills, the responsibilities granted to me have seen an increase. I went from doing the most simple things with supervision, to doing numerous activities independently. I will then make a list of the tasks I have been able to perform.
					<br>The working hours were from 9:30 to 14:00 and from 15:30 to 18:00. Monday to Friday, while Saturday was from 9:30 to 14:30.

					At X3 Solutions, they didn’t need our help. They tried to give us a Udemy course on Docker and a JavaScript course on w3school.com.
					<br>Unlike other experiences, this has been less productive, although we have a good bond with one of the workers, as well as developing an addiction to caffeine.
					<br>The working hours were from 9:30 to 14:00 and from 15:30 to 17:30. From Monday to Friday, while Saturday was from 9:30 to 13:30.
