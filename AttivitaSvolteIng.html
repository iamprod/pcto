						The activities I was responsible for in Terni Digital Week were gradual. At first I tried to help with the graphic design, although later I passed the task on to another person. Then I went to do the work of order, helping to bring and place the material for filming, sheets etc. I was entrusted with the management of computers during the presentations. I dealt with all the technical problems that appeared and manage the presentation files of the real companies.
						<br>Often I remained to help several hours more than those that were written returning, even when almost all were already gone.

						As I said, my experience with RadioGalieo started with transcribing contents from cassette to digital.
						<br> Later: I moved on to make many video montages of the contents obtained from the cassettes; I made video montages of services that would later go on the air; I made the voice that told the news, superimposed on the video recordings made on the spot; I updated the digital photo content and improved the company’s online presence; I learned how to use the software that goes to broadcast, manage the video and show the content on screen to viewers (software that I managed independently); I also made possible the implementation of the broadcast, with live on Instagram stories.
						<br> To finish with the capabilities close to the IT address, I collaborated in the research and maintenance of hardware and software (mainly in the Linux environment), so as to make them functional and usable, for the tasks needed by those who work there.

						In &ldquo;X3 Solutions&ldquo; the activities were not so; dense, but equally valid. They encouraged us to deepen our knowledge of javascript through a site called w3school and provided us with access to a Udemy course on docker. I took the opportunity to learn and take notes, but we did not finish the course.
