				<h3>
				Thanks to the school I had various PCTO experiences.
				<ul><li>At the beginning of the third, a teacher gave us some lessons on company forms
				</li><li>During the period of the DAD: MIUR - Safety at work, and a company that dealt with water power plants
				</li><li>In September, beginning in the fourth grade, I collaborated with Terni Digital.
				</li><li>In June with the stuff of &ldquo;RadioGalileo&ldquo;.
				</li><li>In September this year with that of &ldquo;X3 Solutions&ldquo;.
				</li></ul>
				<br><br>Starting with Terni Digital, I collaborated in the preparation and execution of the event called Terni Digital Week.
				<br> We worked in various locations: at the Coworking of Collescipoli, in the Municipal Library, in the Chamber of Commerce Industry Crafts and Agriculture Terni and in Palazzo Spada.
				<br> Terni Digital has been responsible for the organization of events, the creation of media published on various platforms and the rest of the communication side.
				<br> The event was meant to talk about the various companies that are present in the area in order to make them more known.
				<br><br>
				<br> The next trainee I kept at RadioGalileo ( or TeleGalileo) we are talking about a company located along Corso Tacito.
				<br> RadioGalileo deals with the creation of media. It expands into the internet, television and radio.
				<br> A variety of knowledge is needed to create multimedia content.
				<br>The necessary skills are: video editing, image malipolation, linguistic/argumentative skills to dub the serivizi and to talk on the radio, knowledge of the software used to manage the live shooting, then traspessa on television and social networks such as facebook, instagram and youtube.
				<br>
				<br>Logistically the company is divided into 4 sectors:
				<ul><li>The radio, which transmits music, news and occasionally invites prominent people to dialogue, providing cos&iacute; a form of listening very similar to podcasts.
				</li><li>The broadcast, distributed si various services such as: websites, facebook, youtube, instagram, etc. But also in the form of television broadcasts (although the latter were temporarily suspended in covid time).
				</li><li>The youtube channel, where a lot of energy is dedicated in the creation of content. Countless videos taken from the cassettes of several decades ago are assembled, cut and published, arranged and maintained, cramming them in large closets.
				</li><li>And finally the website, which is the one that collects all the news of local events in the province of Terni. And that we can say supports the local economy by providing advertising to individuals or companies in the area.
				</li></ul>
				<br>Each of these sectors has a dedicated space and one or more managers.
				<br>All the visibility acquired over the years has earned a deep-rooted reputation, linked under its own name, that &eacute; in action for more than 40 years now.
				<br>
				<br>Finally, the experience we had in settembe was carried out in a company called X3 Solutions located behind the Posteitaliane in Piazza dei Bambini. The office is located on the second floor, going left just outside the staircase.
				<br>This company works under commission. Thanks to a chosen team of programmers, they are able to accomplish a myriad of tasks related to their industry.
				<br>The company found itself in difficulty; being the first time it welcomed trainees. However we have carried out some activities, of which I will speak later.
